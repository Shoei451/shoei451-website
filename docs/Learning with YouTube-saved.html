                        <p class="font-medium text-brand-text mt-4 mb-2">Causes:</p>
                        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
                            <li><strong>Economic Motivations</strong>: Driven by the British Empire's adherence to <strong>mercantilism</strong>, which necessitated constant expansion for raw materials and markets.</li>
                            <li><strong>Imperial Rivalry</strong>: Significant conflict between Britain and France over control of North American territories (Mississippi and Ohio River Valleys) and the lucrative fur and deerskin trades.</li>
                            <li><strong>Immediate Trigger</strong>: A land grant to the Ohio Company in 1749, which encroached on French and Native American claims.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="font-medium text-brand-text mt-4 mb-2">Outcomes:</p>
                        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
                            <li><strong>Territorial Changes</strong>: Britain acquired Canada from France and Florida from Spain. France retained economically valuable Caribbean sugar islands.</li>
                            <li><strong>Impact on Native Americans</strong>: They were considered the "real losers." The removal of the French left them to contend solely with the aggressively expanding British, leading to <strong>Pontiac's Rebellion in 1763</strong>.</li>
                            <li><strong>Proclamation Line of 1763</strong>: Issued by the British Parliament to prevent further conflicts, it prohibited colonial settlement west of the Appalachian Mountains. This angered colonists and was largely disregarded.</li>

                            <li><strong>Mercantilism</strong>: The dominant economic theory viewing colonies as providers of raw materials and markets, driving land acquisition and imperial competition.</li>
                            <li><strong>New Political Philosophies</strong>: <strong>Republicanism</strong> emphasized "virtue" and public good, while <strong>Classical Liberalism</strong> (John Locke) posited that government's role is to protect natural rights (life, liberty, property).</li>
                            <li><strong>The Great Awakening</strong>: A religious revival that introduced new denominations and emphasized individual salvation. This eroded respect for established religious and, by extension, political hierarchies.</li>
